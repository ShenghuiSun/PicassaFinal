Your name: Shenghui (Sunny) Sun 
The date you started the assignment: 1/13/12
the date you completed the assignment: 2/7/12
an estimate of the number of hours you worked on it: 20 hours 
     I estimate that it took me 20 hours to complete this assignment just because I had so much trouble debugging my code. I reality, 
     it probably was shorter than that, maybe around 15 hours.

Your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future 
     This assignment really emphasized object oriented languages. In my previous experience programming, I could get away with some 
     "functional" code, but such code would be disastrous in Picassa.
